// Step 1
// In step1.js, write a function, cat.
// It should take one argument, path, and it should read the file with that path, and print the contents of that file.
// Then, write some code that calls that function, allowing you to specify the path argument via the command line. For example:
// 

//$node step1.js one.txt
// This is file one.

// â€‹
// If you give it the path of a non-existent file, it should print that error and halt the script execution:
// 
// $node step1.js huh.txt
// Error reading huh.txt:
//   Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'huh.txt'
